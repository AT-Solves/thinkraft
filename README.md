# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Thinkraft
### by AchieverThoughts

Thinkraft is a structured AI-powered startup mentor and investor readiness platform designed to help founders clarify, validate, and prepare their ideas step-by-step — without altering, inventing, or enhancing the original idea.

Thinkraft ensures founders retain complete ownership and clarity of their thinking while transforming raw ideas into investor-ready narratives.

---

## Core Philosophy

Thinkraft follows one strict principle:

> The AI does not invent ideas. It only helps founders structure and clarify their own thinking.

Unlike traditional AI tools that generate ideas, Thinkraft acts as a disciplined mentor guiding founders through structured phases.

---

## What Thinkraft Does

Thinkraft helps founders:

• Clarify their startup idea  
• Define the real problem being solved  
• Identify target users  
• Establish logical feasibility and viability  
• Prepare structured investor-ready narratives  
• Create clear MVP and roadmap thinking  

All outputs are derived strictly from user inputs.

---

## Guided Phase System

Thinkraft guides users through 3 structured phases:

### Phase 0 — Orientation
Build trust and explain the structured thinking process.

### Phase 1 — Idea Clarity
Clarify problem, user, and value proposition.

### Phase 2 — Evidence and Logic

### Phase 3 — Investor Packaging
Convert structured thinking into investor-ready narrative and pitch structure.
